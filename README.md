# Theme
The Theme of the Website was to keep it Minimalistic and plain.
The plan was to keep the site majority black and white and Using the colour red.
Using the colour red in this way is a contrast to the shades of black and white.
The red really grabs the users attention.
Also I planned to use alot of visual cues and hovers to keep the user engaged.
For example the 3 images all have some sort of motion to them. 
Where as the nav bar changes colour, get larger, and underlines when hovering.
The Logo also changes colour and gets larger with hover as do the social links in the footer.
